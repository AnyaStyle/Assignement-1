        <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
        <article class="text">
            <p>Our story began in <strong>2015</strong>...</p>
            <p>Even then, we realized that something flashed between us then, but we were afraid to admit it to
                ourselves since we had families.
                I remembered about you throughout all these years, I wanted to see you, but I could not afford to call
                you. Well, what could I tell you?</p>
            <p><strong>January 13, 2021</strong> - it was a beautiful sunny day, I was sitting and boring in my office,
                and then I saw you walking along the pier... You have no idea how I jumped with happiness... my
                colleague was surprised, thinking that I saw a very close one me a person (yes! inside of me you were
                very close). You were confused when I ran up; we hugged, but I didn’t feel anything on your part... I
                still took the first step and TXTed you that I was glad to see you, but there was no continuation of our
                communication...</p>
            <p>I continued to remember you sometimes.... What attracted me to you? Mysteriousness, self-confidence,ease
                of communication, charming smile and insanely kind eyes... But most importantly, your vibes are ideal
                for me (I did not know all your other virtues).</p>
            <p><strong>Saturday, July 10, 2021, 9 pm</strong> - I receive a text message from you. On the one hand, I
                was glad to receive it; on the other hand, I thought you had apparently gotten drunk and were looking
                for a company. If it were a day, I would have snapped and come to you, but then I simply replied that I
                was busy.</p>
            <p><strong>July 14, 2021</strong> - another TXT from you and an offer to go to Ohakune... Unexpectedly,
                strange, but wildly attractive... It was interesting for me to spend time with you, not the trip itself.
            </p>
            <p><strong>July 23, 2021</strong> - the trip that turned my mind upside down. I told myself - this is just
                fun, nothing serious can be... But I wanted to feel you more and more...</p>
            <p><strong>August 17, 2021</strong> – lockdown happened… and suddenly we spent 24 hours a day for five weeks
                together. It was a magical time for me, even though we were home.</p>
            <p><strong>September 2, 2021</strong> - you invite us to be a couple. I’m scared, but what if it won’t work
                out, but at the same time I understand that I am falling in love with you already... But you convinced
                me that everything would be fine.</p>
            <p>Everything was okay until <strong>the end of 2021</strong>... I can’t say that it was great since I began
                to dissolve in you, to relax and let everything go by itself. And this cannot be done.</p>
            <p><strong>The beginning of 2022</strong> is a mistake on a mistake... a lot of pretensions on my part...
                the accumulation of grievances on my part and, as a result, breakdowns... I understand that I was
                essentially wrong, and I am ashamed of it... This is a relationship, and it’s okay to swear a little,
                the main thing is to find compromises in the end.</p>
            <p><strong>You are the best</strong>, Joshua, and want to work on our relationship.</p>
