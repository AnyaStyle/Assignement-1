        <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
        <article class="text">
            <p>Our story began in <strong>2015</strong>...</p>
            <p>Back then, we already realized that something flashed between us, but we were afraid to admit it to ourselves since we'd had families. I remembered about You throughout all these years, I wished to see You, but I could not afford to call You. Well, what could I say to You?
            </p>
            <p><strong>January the 13th, 2021 </strong> - it was a beautiful sunny day, I was bored in my office, and then I saw You walking along the pier... You had no idea how I rased with happiness... my colleague was surprised, thinking that I saw a very close one me a person (yes! inside of me You were very close). You were confused when I ran up; we hugged, but I didn’t feel anything on your side... but I took the first step and TXTed You that I was glad to see You, but there was no continuation of our communication...
            </p>
            <p>I continued to remember You from time to time.... What attracted me to You? Mysteriousness, self-confidence, ease of communication, charming smile and insanely kind eyes... But most importantly, your natural vibes are so perfect for me (I did not know all your other virtues).
            </p>
            <p><strong>Saturday, July the 10th, 2021, 9 pm </strong>- I finally received a text message from You. I was surprised to receive it, but I thought You had apparently gotten drunk and were looking for a company. If it were a day time, I would have snapped and come to You, but then I simply replied that I was busy.
            </p>
            <p><strong>July the 14th, 2021 </strong> - another TXT from You and an offer to go to Ohakune... Unexpectedly and strange, but wildly attractive... It was interesting for me to spend time with You, not the trip itself.
            </p>
            <p><strong>July the 23rd, 2021 </strong>- the trip that turned my mind upside down! I told myself - this is just fun, nothing serious can happen... But I wanted to feel You more and more...
            </p>
            <p><strong>August the 17th, 2021 </strong> - lockdown happened… and suddenly we spent 24 hours a day for five weeks together. It was a magical time for me, even though we were stuck at home.</p>
            <p><strong>September the 2nd, 2021 </strong>- You suggested we become a couple. I was scared, what if it won't work out, but at the same time, I realized that I was falling in love with you already... You convinced me that everything would be just fine.
            </p>
            <p>And truly everything was amazing until <strong>the end of 2021</strong>... I can’t say that it was great because I began to dissolve in You, to relax and let everything go by itself. And this cannot be done.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The beginning of 2022 </strong>is a mistake on a mistake... heaps of pretensions... the accumulation of grievances from me and, as a result - breakdowns... I understand that I was essentially wrong, and I am ashamed of it... It is normal to have some difficulties at the beginning of the relationship, but the most important thing is finding compromises and studying each other every day.
            </p>
            <p>My Joshua,<strong>You are the best person </strong>I’ve ever met and want US to work on our relationship and be happy together.
            </p>
